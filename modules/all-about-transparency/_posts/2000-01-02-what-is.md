title: What is Algorithmic Transparency
---

## How do we define "algoirthmic transparency?"

Unfortunately, this is not an easy question to answer.

There is no single definition for **algorithmic transparency.** For the purposes of this course, we define transparency as **“an algorithmic decision-making system's ability to be understood by a human.”** 

This definition is *intentionally* very broad, and can have many different meanings. For exampel, you may wonder, what does *understanding* mean int his context? Who is the **human**?

Importnatly, the definition we present can have different meanings depending on the context. For example, in one situation, transparency may mean that **people are able to anticipate what decision an algorithmic system would make**, and in another context it could mean **knowing the list of factors that are taken into account by the algorithmic system.**

As an analogy, consider that there are many ways to understand how a television set works. You can understand aspects like,
- What it does (ex. displays a picture)
- How to work it (ex. using the remote)
- How it works to the extent that you could fix it if it breaks or reconstruct it from the ground up

This type of tiered understanding can be applied to an algorithmic decision system, where each tier is a component of transparency.

> It’s important to note that data scientists, researchers, managers, and even policymakers use a variety of definitions (and often interchange them) to speak about transparency. For example, researchers and data scientists most commonly use the term **explainability** to mean transparency, but other terms include _interpretability, understandability, intelligibility, comprehensibility, accountability, traceability, and legibility_.

> Having many different definitions is useful for distinguishing nuanced aspects of transparency in a technical setting, but for the purposes of this course you only need to know that all of these definitions refer to **different aspects of human understanding of an algorithmic system.**

To summarize, there are two take-aways for you: (1) know that transparency is related to human understanding, and (2) know that transparency is very broad and can include many different layers.
