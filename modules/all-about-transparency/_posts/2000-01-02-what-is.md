title: What is Algorithmic Transparency
---

## How do we define _algoirthmic transparency?_

**Algorithmic transparency** is the principle that information about decisions made by algorithms should be visible to those who use, regulate, and are affected by the systems that employ those algorithms. Algorithmic transparency should enable the monitoring, checking, criticism, or intervention by interested parties. Generally, algorithmic transparency _is about the human understanding of algorithms_.

Note that there is no single there is no single definition for algorithmic transparency. The definition we provide here is an amalgomation from Policy Briefs on algorithmic transparency and academic work. The definition is intentionally very broad, and can represent multiple meanings.

For example, in one situation, algorithmic transparency may mean that **people are able to anticipate what decision an algorithmic system would make**, and in another context it could mean **knowing the list of factors that are taken into account by the algorithmic system.**

As an analogy, consider that there are many ways to understand how a television set works. You can understand aspects like,
- What it does (ex. displays a picture)
- How to work it (ex. using the remote)
- How it works to the extent that you could fix it if it breaks or reconstruct it from the ground up

> Itâ€™s important to note that data scientists, researchers, managers, and even policymakers use a variety of definitions (and often interchange them) to speak about transparency. For example, researchers and data scientists most commonly use the term **explainability** to mean transparency, but other terms include _interpretability, understandability, intelligibility, comprehensibility, accountability, traceability, and legibility_.

## What are some examples of algorithmic transparency?

- **Hiring:** Algorithms are often used to automatically screen resumes. The companies using those algorithms will likely be interested in understanding how the algorithms are filtering and scoring resumes. Job applicants also have an interest in knowing whether or not their resumes will be screened by humans or algorithms.

- **Credit scores:** A person's credit score is determined by an algoirthm, that combines together factors like their credit score and their outstanding debt. Everyone deserves the right to know what attributes, factors, and inputs are used to generate that risk score.

- **Healthcare:** Advanced computer programs are regularly used to help doctors estimate the risk of disease for their patients. Algorithmic transparency is critiacl in helping the doctor understand why a patient is estimated to be high (or low) risk. In these high stakes environments, algorithmic transparency may literally be a matter of life and death.
