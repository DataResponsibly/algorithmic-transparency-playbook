## The Checklist

The process we describe for implementing algorithmic transparency follows a resource of this course called **The Algorithmic Transparency Checklist.** The checklist is an actionable, step-by-step distillation of how transparnecy can be implemented in your organization. We also recommend that you download the checklist and follow along as you move through the course.
