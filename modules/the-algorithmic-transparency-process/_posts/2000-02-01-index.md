## The Checklist

The process we describe for implementing algorithmic transparency follows a resource of this course called "The Algorithmic Transparency Checklist." The checklist is an actionable, step-by-step distillation of the core content of this course that you can bring with you back to your organization. We also recommend that you download the checklist and follow along as you move through the course.

The checklist is made up of 4 main steps:

- Inventroy
- Plan & Design
- Implement
- Maintain

The remainder of this module discusses the steps and sub-steps of the checklist in detail.
