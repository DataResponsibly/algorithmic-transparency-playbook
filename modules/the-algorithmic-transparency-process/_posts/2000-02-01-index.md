We have distilled our framework for creating algorithmic transparency in your organization down to four main steps. These steps are:

- Inventroy
- Plan & Design
- Implement
- Maintain

To both give process and guide this course, we have created the **Algorithmic Transparency Checklist**. The checklist provides a summary of each step (as well as their respective sub-steps) and by following this checklist, you can ensure that you have properly created transparency for algorithms in your organization.

The remainder of this module discusses the steps and sub-steps of the checklist in detail.
