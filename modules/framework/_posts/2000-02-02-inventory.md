## Step 1: Iventory your algorithmic systems

The first step in implementing algorithmic transparency is to understand everywhere that algorithmic decision-making systems are being used within your organization.

### Step 1A: Create a list of all the algorithmic decision-making systems in your organization

Importantly, the definition of an **algorithmic decision-making system** is quite broad, and includes any system that relies on the analysis of data to derive algorithms for making decisions. Other names for these tools are _automated decision systems, artificial intelligence (AI) systems, machine learning (ML) systems, or data science systems._ In general, algorithmic decision-making tools receive a data input, process that input through an algorithm, and then produce an output in the form of a decision. For example, algorithmic decision-making systems may be used by a company to determine if a loan applicant should be accepted or rejected. In this example, the input would be a loan application, and the output would be the decision to accept or reject that loan application.

> From here forward, we will refer to algorithmic decision-making systems in shorthand as either _algorithmic decision systems, algorithmic systems_, or just simply _algorithms_. In all of these cases, we are referring to the decision-making system as a whole.

The algorithm itself can range from being deceptively simple to extraordinarily complex. In the example above, the algorithm for determining if a loan is accepted could be as simple as “(1) is the applicant’s credit score over 700 and (2) is the applicant’s annual salary greater than \$100,000?” It could also be a complex algorithm that processes vast amounts of data about the applicant like their loan repayment history, demographic information, and purchasing history.

Some examples of algorithmic decision-making systems include hiring tools, predictive algorithms, and smart metering. Predictive algorithms have a wide range of applications including predicting student performance, chance of hospital re-admission, risk of diseases, whether not a loan applicant should be accepted or rejected, or the likelihood a user will click on an advertisement.
